    <p>print (Hello World!) My name is Alejandro Sandoval. Currently, I am a 26 year Program Analyst for the
         State of California. I hail from the small town of Winters, CA and have lived in Northern California all my life. On my spare time, I enjoy powerlifting and have successfully hit a personal best of an accumulative 1250lbs Bench, Squat, and Deadlift. 
         I also enjoy spending time with family and friends. I'm very spontaenous when it comes to road trips so if i'm free, i'm down. I love growth and development. For this reason, I am currently on the journey of being Software Developer. My ultimate goal is to create my own start-up that will provide a service or need to an industry.</p>
